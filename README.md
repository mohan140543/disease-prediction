Heart disease is a major global health concern, and early diagnosis can help prevent severe complications. This project aims to predict heart disease based on medical attributes using a machine learning model. The dataset includes key health indicators such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol level (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression (oldpeak), slope of the ST segment (slope), number of major vessels (ca), and thalassemia type (thal). The target variable represents whether a person has heart disease. The model is trained using classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in assessing heart disease risk efficiently.
